# Project Overview

This section provides a brief overview of your scraping project. Describe the target website, the data you intend to extract, and the purpose of scraping. Explain the overall structure of your code.

### Scraping Script (`script.py`)

This section explains your main scraping script (`script.py` or similar). Briefly describe:

- Fetching Data: How the script fetches the webpage content using requests.
- Parsing Data: How the script utilizes BeautifulSoup to navigate through the HTML structure and extract the desired data.
